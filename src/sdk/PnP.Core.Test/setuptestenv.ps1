<#
.SYNOPSIS
Creates the needed sites (communitation site with sub site + group connected team site with sub site and Team) for doing "live" testing of the PnP Microsoft 365 Library.

This script creates:
- A communication site named pnpcoresdktest with a sub site named subsite
- A modern team site which uses the group name pnpcoresdktestgroup and has a sub site anmed subsite. The group connected to this site also does have a Team connected (teamified site)
- a test document named test.docx

Note: You do need to have an app catalog setup before running this script. Check if Get-PnPTenantAppCatalogUrl returns an app catalog url if you are in doubt
